This is a simple doctest that checks some of Python's arithmetic operations
>>> 2+2
4
>>> 3*3
10

>>> import sys
>>> def test_write():
...    sys.stdout.write("Hello\n")
...    return True
>>> test_write()
Hello
True

The fib(N) function takes a single integer as its only parameter N. If N is 0 or 1, the
 function returns, 1. If
N is less than 0, the function raises a ValueError. Otherwise, the function returns the sum of fib(N-1)
and fib(N-2). The returned value will never be less than 1.On versions of Python older than 2.2, and if N is
at least 52, the function will raise an OverflowError. A naive implementation of this
function would get very slow as N increased.
>>> def fib(N):
...    if N < 0:
...       raise ValueError
...    elif N == 0:
...       return 1
...    elif N == 1:
...       return 1
...    else:
...       return fib(N-2)+fib(N-1)
>>> fib(6)
